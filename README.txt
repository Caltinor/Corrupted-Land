Corrupted Land Roadmap
------------------------------

Planned features:
- corruption of all blocks (using a graphical overlay and chunk caps to control how corruption is tracked)
- JEI recipe for Purifier
- Updated texture for Purifier with visual differences based on charge
- Compat with mystical pumpkins (immunity and spread prevention)


------------------------------
Mod Philosophy
------------------------------
Corrupted land was made for SpookyJam 2020.  The core idea behind it was to create a cold desolate spreading
antagonistic force that affected the world.  It is the block based version of a mob that players need to
deal with in their own way.
